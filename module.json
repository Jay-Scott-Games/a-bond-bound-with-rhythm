  "description": "Foundry Module for A Bond Bound with Ribbon\nA festive and frisky one-shot adventure for 4th-level characters.\n\nWinter Week is a time for feasting, friends, and casting fear aside to focus on your heartâ€™s desire. To mark the beginning of the festival, the PCs attend the Ribbons and Blade celebration, where a night of singing and drinking unexpectedly turns into a showdown between a devil and celestial, a confrontation over a stolen diabolic contract. The PCs fight hellish minions and navigate a hedge maze before confronting the devil in a battle to save a precious soul.\n\nWritten by Jay Scott - www.jayscottgames.com\nArt assets - Designed by Freepik (www.freepik.com)",
